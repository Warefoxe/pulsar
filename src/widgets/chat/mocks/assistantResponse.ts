export const assistantResponse = `"Love" is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been explored in various disciplines, including philosophy, psychology, and literature, throughout human history. While it can be challenging to define precisely due to its subjective nature and the diversity of experiences associated with it, love is often described as a deep and intense emotional connection or attachment between individuals. It involves feelings of affection, care, compassion, empathy, and often includes a desire for closeness, intimacy, and mutual understanding.

Love can manifest in many forms, including romantic love between partners, familial love between family members, platonic love between friends, and even a broader sense of love for humanity or the world around us. It can bring joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose to people's lives, but it can also involve challenges, sacrifices, and complexities.

Ultimately, love is a deeply personal and subjective experience, and its meaning and significance can vary greatly from person to person and across different cultures and contexts.`;
